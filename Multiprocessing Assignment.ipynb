    "**Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to utilize multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space. Multiprocessing is useful for achieving parallelism and leveraging multiple CPU cores effectively. It allows tasks to be executed simultaneously, improving performance and scalability, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrency:** Multiprocessing achieves concurrency by running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space. Multithreading achieves concurrency within a single process by running multiple threads of execution, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "- **Parallelism:** Multiprocessing can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, enabling true parallelism. Multithreading may not achieve true parallelism because threads within the same process share the same global interpreter lock (GIL) in Python, limiting execution to one thread at a time.\n",
    "- **Memory:** Each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, reducing the risk of memory corruption and making it easier to reason about memory management. In multithreading, threads share the same memory space, which can lead to issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Write a Python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=my_function, args=(\"Alice\",))\n",
    "    process.start()\n",
    "    process.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a way to manage a pool of worker processes that can execute tasks asynchronously. It provides a convenient interface for distributing work across multiple processes and collecting results. Multiprocessing pools are useful for parallelizing tasks that can be divided into independent units of work, such as processing data in parallel or performing batch computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How can we create a pool of worker processes in Python using the multiprocessing module?**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function(x):\n",
    "    return x*x\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Create a multiprocessing pool with 4 worker processes\n",
    "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "        # Distribute work across the pool of processes\n",
    "        result = pool.map(my_function, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "        print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Write a Python program to create 4 processes, each process should print a different number using the multiprocessing module in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_number(num):\n",
    "    print(f\"Process {num}: {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    processes = []\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 5):\n",
    "        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(i,))\n",
    "        processes.append(process)\n",
    "        process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    for process in processes:\n",
    "        process.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program creates 4 processes, each printing a different number from 1 to 4. The `print_number` function is called with a different number as an argument for each process. Finally, the `join` method is called on each process to wait for them to complete their execution."
